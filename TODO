People are encouraged to pick some of these and implement it.  Send
all patches to cbagwell@users.sourceforge.net.

  o Still passing some options using CFLAGS instead of stconfig.h.

  o Lots of effects are sing "double" to prevent overflow of
    st_sample_t math.  With ststdint.h we now have a portable way
    of detecting uin64_t...  Use that when possible to speed up
    math (won't have to convert back and forth from int to float).

  o Several files are using hard-coded #'s instead of ST_SAMPLE_MIN/MAX.
    Change these.

  o Make a global version of MIN/MAX instead of sprinkled min/max/MIN/MAX

  o Make a global version of clip() instead of sprinked in all files.

  o Add support to all file handlers to handle 32-bit and float
    data types since raw functions can handle them.

  o All comment code has a memory leak.  They must malloc memory to
    store comment but its never free()'d.

  o Comment strings.  Some file formats have space for embedded comments.
    These are currently thrown away.  Printing them out, carrying them
    forward, and an option to add new ones would be handy.

  o Add support for .TXT format as Cooledit supports.  Not really fit for
    graphing since it is only a stream of ascii sample values but some
    program appear to like it.  Also has a much nicer header.

  o Keep sox from using "fail" on errors.  Sox was supposed to be
    a sound library called "ST" but libraries shouldn't exit a program,
    they should return error codes for users to handle.  Initial support
    for this has been added.  Needs to be completed.

  o Enhance general robustness... For instance, malloc is called in
    lots of places without checking its return value.  See last option
    as well.

SOX includes skeleton format files to assist you in supporting new 
formats, sound effect loops, and special-purpose programs.
The full skeleton format, skel.c, helps you write a driver 
for a new format which has data structures.  Skeleff.c is
a starting point for writing a sound effect loop.  Sox.c is
a good starting point for new programs.  (Someone finally
did this and told me what was wrong...)

In handlers.c, note that many formats set up the header and then
use the raw driver for reading and writing.
