DESCRIPTION
       Sox  translates	sound  files  from one format to another,
       possibly doing a sound effect.

OPTIONS
       The option syntax is a little grotty, but in essence:
	    sox file.au file.voc
       translates a sound sample in SUN Sparc .AU format  into	a
       SoundBlaster .VOC file, while

SoX(1)							   SoX(1)


	    sox -v 0.5 file.au -r 12000 file.voc rate
       does  the  same	format	translation  but  also lowers the
       amplitude by 1/2 and changes the sampling rate  from  8000
       hertz to 12000 hertz via the rate sound effect loop.

       File type options:

       -t filetype
		 gives the type of the sound sample file.

       -r rate	 Give sample rate in Hertz of file.

       -s/-u/-U/-A/-a/-g
		 The  sample  data  is signed linear (2's comple-
		 ment), unsigned linear, U-law (logarithmic),  A-
		 law  (logarithmic), ADPCM, or GSM.  U-law and A-
		 law are the U.S. and international standards for
		 logarithmic  telephone sound compression.  ADPCM
		 is form of sound compression  that  has  a  good
		 compromise  between  good sound quality and fast
		 encoding/decoding time.  GSM is a standard  used
		 for  telephone	 sound	compression  in	 European
		 countries and its gaining popularity because  of
		 its quality.

       -b/-w/-l/-f/-d/-D
		 The  sample  data  is	in  bytes,  16-bit words,
		 32-bit longwords, 32-bit floats,  64-bit  double
		 floats,  or 80-bit IEEE floats.  Floats and dou-
		 ble floats are in native machine format.

       -x	 The sample data is in XINU format; that  is,  it
		 comes	from  a	 machine  with	the opposite word
		 order than yours and must be  swapped	according
		 to  the  word-size given above.  Only 16-bit and
		 32-bit integer data may  be  swapped.	 Machine-
		 format	 floating-point	 data  is  not	portable.
		 IEEE floats are a fixed, portable format. ???

       -c channels
		 The number of sound channels in the  data  file.
		 This  may  be	1,  2, or 4; for mono, stereo, or
		 quad sound data.

       General options:

       -e	 after the input file allows you to avoid  giving
		 an output file and just name an effect.  This is
		 mainly useful with the stat effect  but  can  be
		 used with others.

       -h	 Print version number and usage information.

       -p	 Run  in  preview  mode	 and run fast.	This will

		 somewhat speed up sox when the output format has
		 a  different  number of channels and a different
		 rate then the input file.  The	 order	that  the
		 effects  are run in will be arranged for maximum
		 speed and not quality.

       -v volume Change amplitude (floating point); less than 1.0
		 decreases, greater than 1.0 increases.	 Note: we
		 perceive volume logarithmically,  not	linearly.
		 Note: see the stat effect.

       -V	 Print	a description of processing phases.  Use-
		 ful for figuring out exactly how sox is mangling
		 your sound samples.

       The  input and output files may be standard input and out-
       put.  This is specified by '-'.	The -t type  option  must
       be  given  in this case, else sox will not know the format
       of   the	  given	  file.	   The	 -t,   -r,   -s/-u/-U/-A,
       -b/-w/-l/-f/-d/-D  and  -x options refer to the input data
       when given before the input file name.  After, they  refer
       to the output data.

       If  you don't give an output file name, sox will just read
       the input file.	This is useful for validating  structured
       file  formats; the stat effect may also be used via the -e
       option.

FILE TYPES
       Sox needs to know the formats  of  the  input  and  output
       files.	File  formats  which have headers are checked, if
       that header doesn't seem right, the program exits with  an
       appropriate  message.   Currently,  raw (no header) binary
       and textual data, Amiga 8SVX, Apple/SGI	AIFF,  SPARC  .AU
       (w/header),  NeXT  .SND,	 CD-R, CVSD, GSM 06.10, Mac HCOM,
       Sound Tools MAUD, OSS device drivers, Turtle  Beach  .SMP,
       Sound  Blaster,	Sndtool,  and  Sounder,	 Sun Audio device
       driver, Yamaha TX-16W Sampler, IRCAM  Sound  Files,   Cre-
       ative  Labs  VOC,  Psion	 .WVE, and Microsoft RIFF/WAV are
       supported.


       .8svx	 Amiga 8SVX musical instrument	description  for-
		 mat.

       .aiff	 AIFF  files  used  on	Apple  IIc/IIgs	 and SGI.
		 Note: the AIFF format	supports  only	one  SSND
		 chunk.	  It  does  not	 support  multiple  sound
		 chunks, or the 8SVX musical instrument	 descrip-
		 tion format.  AIFF files are multimedia archives
		 and and can  have  multiple  audio  and  picture
		 chunks.   You	may  need  a separate archiver to
		 work with them.

       .au	 SUN Microsystems AU files.  There are apparently
		 many  types  of  .au files; DEC has invented its
		 own with  a  different	 magic	number	and  word
		 order.	 The .au handler can read these files but
		 will not write them.  Some .au files have  valid
		 AU  headers  and  some	 do  not.  The latter are
		 probably original SUN	u-law  8000  hz	 samples.
		 These	can  be	 dealt	with using the .ul format
		 (see below).

       .cdr	 CD-R
		 CD-R files are used in mastering  music  Compact
		 Disks.	 The file format is, as you might expect,
		 raw stereo raw unsigned samples at 44khz.   But,
		 there's some blocking/padding oddity in the for-
		 mat, so it needs its own handler.

       .cvs	 Continuously Variable Slope Delta modulation
		 Used to compress speech audio	for  applications
		 such as voice mail.

       .dat	 Text Data files
		 These	files contain a textual representation of
		 the sample data.   There  is  one  line  at  the
		 beginning that contains the sample rate.  Subse-
		 quent lines contain two numeric data items:  the
		 time  since  the beginning of the sample and the
		 sample value.	Values are normalized so that the
		 maximum  and  minimum	are 1.00 and -1.00.  This
		 file format can be used to create data files for
		 external programs such as FFT analyzers or graph
		 routines.  SoX can also convert a file	 in  this
		 format	 back into one of the other file formats.

       .gsm	 GSM 06.10 Lossy Speech Compression
		 A standard for compressing speech which is  used
		 in  the Global Standard for Mobil telecommunica-
		 tions (GSM).  Its good for its purpose,  shrink-
		 ing  audio data size, but it will introduce lots
		 of noise when a given sound  sample  is  encoded
		 and decoded multiple times.  This format is used
		 by some voice mail applications.  It  is  rather
		 CPU  intensive.   GSM	in  sox	 is  optional and
		 requires access to an external GSM library.   To
		 see  if  there is support for gsm run sox -h and
		 look for it under the	list  of  supported  file
		 formats.

       .hcom	 Macintosh  HCOM  files.   These are (apparently)
		 Mac FSSD files with some variant of Huffman com-
		 pression.   The Macintosh has wacky file formats
		 and this format handler apparently doesn't  han-
		 dle all the ones it should.  Mac users will need
		 your usual arsenal of file  converters	 to  deal

		 with an HCOM file under Unix or DOS.

       .maud	 An Amiga format
		 An IFF-conform sound file type, registered by MS
		 MacroSystem Computer GmbH, published along  with
		 the  "Toccata"	 sound-card on the Amiga.  Allows
		 8bit linear, 16bit linear, A-Law, u-law in  mono
		 and stereo.

       ossdsp	 OSS /dev/dsp device driver
		 This is a psuedo-file type and can be optionally
		 compiled into Sox.  Run sox -h	 to  see  if  you
		 have  support	for  this  file	 type.	When this
		 driver is used it allows you to open up the  OSS
		 /dev/dsp  file	 and configure it to use the same
		 data type as passed in to  Sox.   It  works  for
		 both  playing and recording sound samples.  When
		 playing sound files it attempts to  set  up  the
		 OSS  driver  to use the same format as the input
		 file.	It is suggested to  always  override  the
		 output values to use the highest quality samples
		 your sound card can handle.  Example: -t  ossdsp
		 -w -s /dev/dsp

       .sf	 IRCAM Sound Files.
		 SoundFiles  are  used by academic music software
		 such as the  CSound  package,	and  the  MixView
		 sound sample editor.

       .smp	 Turtle Beach SampleVision files.
		 SMP  files  are  for use with the PC-DOS package
		 SampleVision by  Turtle  Beach	 Softworks.  This
		 package  is  for  communication  to several MIDI
		 samplers. All sample rates are supported by  the
		 package,  although  not all are supported by the
		 samplers themselves. Currently loop  points  are
		 ignored.

       sunau	 Sun /dev/audio device driver
		 This is a psuedo-file type and can be optionally
		 compiled into Sox.  Run sox -h	 to  see  if  you
		 have  support	for  this  file	 type.	When this
		 driver is used it allows you to open  up  a  Sun
		 /dev/audio file and configure it to use the same
		 data type as passed in to  Sox.   It  works  for
		 both  playing and recording sound samples.  When
		 playing sound files it attempts to  set  up  the
		 audio driver to use the same format as the input
		 file.	It is suggested to  always  override  the
		 output values to use the highest quality samples
		 your hardware can handle.  Example: -t sunau  -w
		 -s /dev/audio or -t sunau -U -c 1 /dev/audio for
		 older sun equipment.

       .txw	 Yamaha TX-16W sampler.
		 A file format from a  Yamaha  sampling	 keyboard
		 which	wrote  IBM-PC format 3.5" floppies.  Han-
		 dles reading of files which do not have the sam-
		 ple  rate  field  set	to one of the expected by
		 looking at some other bytes in	 the  attack/loop
		 length	 fields,  and  defaulting to 33kHz if the
		 sample rate is still unknown.

       .vms	 More info to come.
		 Used to compress speech audio	for  applications
		 such as voice mail.

       .voc	 Sound Blaster VOC files.
		 VOC  files  are  multi-part  and contain silence
		 parts, looping, and different sample  rates  for
		 different  chunks.   On input, the silence parts
		 are filled out, loops are rejected,  and  sample
		 data	with  a	 new  sample  rate  is	rejected.
		 Silence with a different sample rate  is  gener-
		 ated  appropriately.	On output, silence is not
		 detected, nor are impossible sample rates.

       .wav	 Microsoft .WAV RIFF files.
		 These appear to be very similar  to  IFF  files,
		 but  not  the	same.	They are the native sound
		 file format of Windows.  (Obviously, Windows was
		 of  such  incredible  importance to the computer
		 industry that it just had to have its own  sound
		 file format.)	Normally .wav files have all for-
		 matting information in their headers, and so  do
		 not  need  any	 format	 options specified for an
		 input file. If any are, they will  override  the
		 file  header,	and  you  will	be warned to this
		 effect.  You had better know what you are doing!
		 Output	 format	 options will cause a format con-
		 version, and the  .wav	 will  written	appropri-
		 ately.	  Note	that it is possible to write data
		 of a type that cannot be specified by	the  .wav
		 header,  and you will be warned that you a writ-
		 ing a bad file !  Sox currently  can  read  PCM,
		 ULAW,	ALAW,  MS  ADPCM, and IMA (or DVI) ADPCM.
		 It can output all of these  formats  except  the
		 ADPCM styles.

       .wve	 Psion 8-bit alaw
		 These	are  8-bit a-law 8khz sound files used on
		 the Psion palmtop portable computer.

       .raw	 Raw files (no header).
		 The sample rate, size	(byte,	word,  etc),  and
		 style	(signed,  unsigned,  etc.)  of the sample
		 file must be  given.	The  number  of	 channels
		 defaults to 1.



			  March 5, 1999				6





SoX(1)							   SoX(1)


       .ub, .sb, .uw, .sw, .ul
		 These	are  several  suffices	which  serve as a
		 shorthand for raw files with a	 given	size  and
		 style.	  Thus, ub, sb, uw, sw, and ul correspond
		 to "unsigned  byte",  "signed	byte",	"unsigned
		 word",	 "signed  word",  and "ulaw" (byte).  The
		 sample rate defaults to 8000 hz if  not  explic-
		 itly set, and the number of channels (as always)
		 defaults to 1.	 There are lots of Sparc  samples
		 floating  around  in u-law format with no header
		 and fixed at a sample rate of 8000 hz.	 (Certain
		 sound management software cheerfully ignores the
		 headers.)  Similarly, most Mac sound  files  are
		 in  unsigned  byte  format with a sample rate of
		 11025 or 22050 hz.

       .auto	 This is a ``meta-type'':  specifying  this  type
		 for  an input file triggers some code that tries
		 to guess the real  type  by  looking  for  magic
		 words	in  the	 header.   If  the  type can't be
		 guessed, the program exits with  an  error  mes-
		 sage.	 The  input  must  be a plain file, not a
		 pipe.	This type can't be used for output files.

EFFECTS
       Only one effect from the palette may be applied to a sound
       sample.	To do multiple effects you'll need to run sox  in
       a pipeline.

       avg [ -l | -r ]
		 Reduce	 the  number of channels by averaging the
		 samples, or duplicate channels to  increase  the
		 number	 of channels.  Valid combinations are 1 -
		 2, 1 - 4, 2 - 4, 4 - 2, 4 - 1, 2 - 1. The -l  or
		 -r option averages from just left or right chan-
		 nels/duplicates to just the left or right  chan-
		 nels.

       band [ -n ] center [ width ]
		 Apply	 a   band-pass	 filter.   The	frequency
		 response drops logarithmically around the center
		 frequency.   The  width  gives	 the slope of the
		 drop.	The frequencies at  center  +  width  and
		 center	 -  width  will be half of their original
		 amplitudes.  Band defaults to a mode oriented to
		 pitched signals, i.e. voice, singing, or instru-
		 mental music.	The -n (for  noise)  option  uses
		 the alternate mode for un-pitched signals.  Band
		 introduces noise in the  shape	 of  the  filter,
		 i.e.  peaking	at  the center frequency and set-
		 tling around it.

SoX(1)							   SoX(1)


	      -s | -t [ delay decay speed depth -s | -t ... ]
		 Add a chorus to a sound sample.  Each	quadtuple
		 delay/decay/speed/depth  gives the delay in mil-
		 liseconds and the decay  (relative  to	 gain-in)
		 with  a  modulation  speed  in Hz using depth in
		 milliseconds.	The modulation is either sinodial
		 (-s) or triangular (-t).  Gain-out is the volume
		 of the output.

       copy	 Copy the input file to the output file.  This is
		 the  default  effect if both files have the same
		 sampling rate, or the rates are "close".

       cut loopnumber
		 Extract loop #N from a sample.

       deemph	 Apply a treble attenuation  shelving  filter  to
		 samples  in  audio  cd	 format.   The	frequency
		 response of pre-emphasized recordings is  recti-
		 fied.	 The filtering is defined in the standard
		 document ISO 908.

       echo gain-in gain-out delay decay [ delay decay ... ]
		 Add echoing to a sound sample.	 Each delay/decay
		 part  gives  the  delay  in milliseconds and the
		 decay (relative to gain-in) of that echo.  Gain-
		 out is the volume of the output.

       echos gain-in gain-out delay decay [ delay decay ... ]
		 Add a sequence of echos to a sound sample.  Each
		 delay/decay part gives the delay in milliseconds
		 and  the  decay  (relative  to	 gain-in) of that
		 echo.	Gain-out is the volume of the output.

       flanger gain-in gain-out delay decay speed -s | -t
		 Add a flanger to a sound  sample.   Each  triple
		 delay/decay/speed  gives  the delay in millisec-
		 onds and the decay (relative to gain-in) with	a
		 modulation  speed  in	Hz.   The  modulation  is
		 either sinodial (-s) or triangular (-t).   Gain-
		 out is the volume of the output.

       highp center
		 Apply	 a   high-pass	 filter.   The	frequency
		 response drops logarithmically with center  fre-
		 quency	 in the middle of the drop.  The slope of
		 the filter is quite gentle.

       lowp center
		 Apply a low-pass filter.  The frequency response
		 drops	logarithmically	 with center frequency in
		 the middle of the drop.  The slope of the filter
		 is quite gentle.

SoX(1)							   SoX(1)


       map	 Display a list of loops in a sample, and miscel-
		 laneous loop info.

       mask	 Add "masking  noise"  to  signal.   This  effect
		 deliberately  adds  white  noise  to  a sound in
		 order to mask quantization effects,  created  by
		 the  process  of  playing a sound digitally.  It
		 tends to mask buzzing voices, for  example.   It
		 adds  1/2  bit of noise to the sound file at the
		 output bit depth.

       phaser gain-in gain-out delay decay speed -s | -t
		 Add a phaser to a  sound  sample.   Each  triple
		 delay/decay/speed  gives  the delay in millisec-
		 onds and the decay (relative to gain-in) with	a
		 modulation  speed  in	Hz.   The  modulation  is
		 either sinodial (-s) or  triangular  (-t).   The
		 decay should be less than 0.5 to avoid feedback.
		 Gain-out is the volume of the output.

       pick	 Select the left or right  channel  of	a  stereo
		 sample,  or  one  of  four channels in a quadro-
		 phonic sample.

       polyphase [ -w < num / ham > ]

		 [  -width <  long  / short  / # > ]

		 [ -cutoff #  ]
		 Translate input sampling rate to output sampling
		 rate  via  polyphase  interpolation, a DSP algo-
		 rithm.	 This method is slow  and  uses	 lots  of
		 RAM, but gives much better results then rate.
		 -w  <	nut / ham > : select either a Nuttal (~90
		 dB stopband) or Hamming (~43 dB  stopband)  win-
		 dow.  Warning: Nuttall windows require 2x length
		 than Hamming windows.	Default is nut.
		 -width long / short / # : specify the	width  of
		 the  filter.  long is 1024 samples; short is 128
		 samples.  Alternatively, an exact number can  be
		 used.	Default is long.
		 -cutoff  # : specify the filter cutoff frequency
		 in terms of fraction of  bandwidth.   If  upsam-
		 pling,	 then this is the fraction of the orignal
		 signal that should go through.	 If downsampling,
		 this  is  the	fraction of the signal left after
		 downsampling.	Default is 0.95.   Remember  that
		 this is a float.


       rate	 Translate input sampling rate to output sampling
		 rate via linear interpolation to the Least  Com-
		 mon Multiple of the two sampling rates.  This is
		 the  default  effect  if  the	two  files   have



			  March 5, 1999				9





SoX(1)							   SoX(1)


		 different  sampling  rates.   This  is	 fast but
		 noisy: the spectrum of the original  sound  will
		 be  shifted  upwards and duplicated faintly when
		 up-translating	 by  a	multiple.   Lerp-ing   is
		 acceptable  for  cheap 8-bit sound hardware, but
		 for CD-quality	 sound	you  should  instead  use
		 either	 resample  or polyphase.  If you are won-
		 dering which of Sox's rate changing  effects  to
		 ues,  you  will want to read a detailed analysis
		 of all of them at http://usa.ece.cmu.edu/Sox/

       resample [ rolloff [ beta ] ]
		 Translate input sampling rate to output sampling
		 rate  via  simulated  analog  filtration.   This
		 method is slower than rate, but gives much  bet-
		 ter results.  rolloff refers to the cut-off fre-
		 quency of the low pass filter and  is	given  in
		 terms	of  the	 Nyquist  frequency for the lower
		 sample rate.  rolloff therefor should	be  some-
		 thing	between	 0. and 1., in practice 0.8-0.95.
		 beta trades stop band rejection against  transi-
		 tion  width  from passband to stop band.  Larger
		 beta means a slower transition and greater stop-
		 band rejection.  beta should be at least greater
		 than 2.  The default is rollof 0.8,  beta  17.5,
		 which	is  rather  conservative  with respect to
		 aliasing.  Lower beta and higher rolloff  values
		 preserve  more high frequency signal energy, but
		 introduce measurable artifacts.

       reverb gain-out delay [ delay ... ]
		 Add reverbation to a sound sample.   Each  delay
		 is  given  in	milliseconds  and its feedback is
		 depending on the  reverb-time	in  milliseconds.
		 Each  delay  should  be  in the range of half to
		 quarter of reverb-time to get a realistic rever-
		 bation.  Gain-out is the volume of the output.

       reverse	 Reverse  the  sound sample completely.	 Included
		 for finding Satanic subliminals.

       split	 Turn a mono sample into a stereo sample by copy-
		 ing  the  input  channel  to  the left and right
		 channels.

       stat [ debug | -v ]
		 Do a statistical check on the	input  file,  and
		 print	results on the standard error file.  stat
		 may copy the file untouched from input	 to  out-
		 put,  if you select an output file.  The "Volume
		 Adjustment:" field in the statistics  gives  you
		 the  argument	to  the -v number which will make
		 the sample as loud as possible without clipping.
		 There	is  an	optional  parameter  -v that will



			  March 5, 1999			       10





SoX(1)							   SoX(1)


		 print out the "Volume Adjustment:" field's value
		 and  return.  This could be of use in scripts to
		 auto convert the volume.  There is  an	 also  an
		 optional  parameter  debug  that  will place sox
		 into debug mode and print out a hex dump of  the
		 sound	file  from the internal buffer that is in
		 32-bit signed PCM data.  This is mainly only  of
		 use  in tracking down endian problems that creep
		 in to sox on cross-platform versions.

       vibro speed  [ depth ]
		 Add the world-famous  Fender  Vibro-Champ  sound
		 effect to a sound sample by using a sine wave as
		 the volume knob.  Speed gives the Hertz value of
		 the  wave.   This must be under 30.  Depth gives
		 the amount the volume is cut into  by	the  sine
		 wave,	ranging 0.0 to 1.0 and defaulting to 0.5.

       Sox enforces certain effects.  If the two files have  dif-
       ferent sampling rates, the requested effect must be one of
       copy, or rate, If the two files have different numbers  of
       channels, the avg effect must be requested.

BUGS
       The  syntax  is horrific.  It's very tempting to include a
       default system that allows an effect name as  the  program
       name  and just pipes a sound sample from standard input to
       standard output, but the problem of inputting  the  sample
       rates makes this unworkable.

       Please  report  any  bugs  found in this version of sox to
