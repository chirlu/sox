.TH SoX 7 "April 17, 2007" "soxformat" "Sound eXchange"
.SH NAME
SoX \- Sound eXchange, the Swiss Army knife of audio manipulation
.SH DESCRIPTION
File types that can be determined by a filename
extension are listed with their names preceded by a dot.
.SP
File types
that require an external library, such as ffmpeg or libsndfile, are
marked e.g. `\fB(ffmpeg)\fR'. File types that can be handled by an
external library via its pseudo file type (currently libsndfile or
ffmpeg) are marked e.g. `\fB(also with \-t sndfile)\fR'. This might be
useful if you have a file that doesn't work with SoX's default format
readers and writers, and there's an external reader or writer for that
format.
.SP
.TP
.B .raw (also with \-t sndfile)
Raw (headerless) audio files.  The sample rate, sample size, and data
encoding must be given using command-line format options; the number of
channels defaults to 1.
.TP
\&\fB.ub\fR, \fB.sb\fR, \fB.uw\fR, \fB.sw\fR, \fB.ul\fR, \fB.al\fR, \fB.lu\fR, \fB.la\fR, \fB.sl\fR \fB(also with \-t sndfile)\fR
These filename extensions serve as shorthand for identifying the format
of headerless audio files.  Thus, \fBub\fR, \fBsb\fR, \fBuw\fR,
\fBsw\fR, \fBul\fR, \fBal\fR, \fBlu\fR, \fBla\fR and \fBsl\fR indicate a
file with a single audio channel, sample rate of 8000\ Hz, and samples
encoded as `unsigned byte', `signed byte', `unsigned word', `signed
word', `\(*m-law' (byte), `A-law' (byte), inverse bit order `\(*m-law',
inverse bit order `A-law', or `signed long' respectively.  Command-line
format options can also be given to modify the selected format if it
does not provide an exact match for a particular file.
.SP
Headerless audio files on a SPARC computer are likely to be of format
\fBul\fR;  on a Mac, they're likely to be \fBub\fR but with a
sample rate of 11025 or 22050\ Hz.
.TP
.B .8svx (also with \-t sndfile)
Amiga 8SVX musical instrument description format.
.TP
\&\fB.aiff\fR, \fB.aif\fR \fB(also with \-t sndfile)\fR
AIFF files used on Apple IIc/IIgs and SGI.
Note: the AIFF format supports only one SSND chunk.
It does not support multiple audio chunks,
or the 8SVX musical instrument description format.
AIFF files are multimedia archives and
can have multiple audio and picture chunks.
You may need a separate archiver to work with them.
.TP
\&\fB.aiffc\fR, \fB.aifc\fR \fB(also with \-t sndfile)\fR
AIFF-C (not compressed, linear), defined in DAVIC 1.4 Part 9 Annex B.
This format is referred from ARIB STD-B24, which is specified for
Japanese data broadcasting.  Any private chunks are not supported.
.SP
Note: The input file is currently processed as .aiff.
.TP
.B alsa
ALSA device driver.
This is a pseudo-file type and can be optionally compiled into SoX.  Run
.EX
	sox -h
.EE
to see if you have support for this file type.  When this driver is used
it allows you to open up a ALSA device and configure it to
use the same data format as passed in to SoX.
It works for both playing and recording audio files.  When playing audio
files it attempts to set up the ALSA driver to use the same format as the
input file.  It is suggested to always override the output values to use
the highest quality format your ALSA system can handle.  Example:
.EX
	sox infile -t alsa default
.EE
.TP
\&\fB.amr\-nb\fR
Adaptive Multi Rate\*mNarrow Band speech codec; a lossy format used in 3rd
generation mobile telephony and defined in 3GPP TS 26.071 et al.
.SP
AMR-NB audio has a fixed sampling rate of 8 kHz and supports encoding
to the following bit-rates (as selected by the
.B \-C
option): 0 = 4\*d75 kbit/s, 1 = 5\*d15 kbit/s, 2 = 5\*d9 kbit/s, 3 =
6\*d7 kbit/s, 4 = 7\*d4 kbit/s 5 = 7\*d95 kbit/s, 6 = 10\*d2
kbit/s, 7 = 12\*d2 kbit/s.
.SP
This format in SoX is optional and requires access to external libraries.
To see if there is support for this format, enter
.EX
	sox -h
.EE
and look for it under the list:
.IR "SUPPORTED FILE FORMATS" .
.TP
\&\fB.amr\-wb\fR
Adaptive Multi Rate\*mWide Band speech codec; a lossy format used in 3rd
generation mobile telephony and defined in 3GPP TS 26.171 et al.
.SP
AMR-WB audio has a fixed sampling rate of 16 kHz and supports encoding
to the following bit-rates (as selected by the
.B \-C
option): 0 = 6\*d6 kbit/s, 1 = 8\*d85 kbit/s, 2 = 12\*d65 kbit/s, 3 =
14\*d25 kbit/s, 4 = 15\*d85 kbit/s 5 = 18\*d25 kbit/s, 6 = 19\*d85
kbit/s, 7 = 23\*d05 kbit/s, 8 = 23\*d85 kbit/s.
.SP
This format in SoX is optional and requires access to external libraries.
To see if there is support for this format on your system, enter
.EX
	sox -h
.EE
and look for it under the list:
.IR "SUPPORTED FILE FORMATS" .
.TP
.B ao
libao device driver.
This is a pseudo-file type and can be optionally compiled into SoX.  Run
.EX
	sox -h
.EE
to see if you have support for this file type. It works only for
playing audio files. It can play to a wide range of devices and sound
systems. See its documentation for the full range. At the moment SoX's
use of libao cannot be configured directly; you must use libao
configuration files.
.TP
\&\fB.au\fR, \fB.snd\fR \fB(also with \-t sndfile)\fR
Sun Microsystems AU files.
There are many types of AU file;
DEC has invented its own with a different magic number
and byte order.
SoX can read these files but will not write them.
Some .au files are known to have invalid AU headers; these
are probably original Sun \(*m-law 8000\ Hz files and
can be dealt with using the
.B .ul
format (see below).
.SP
It is possible to override AU file header information
with the
.B \-r
and
.B \-c
options, in which case SoX will issue a warning to that effect.
.TP
\fBauto\fR
This format type name exists for backwards compatibility only.
If given for an input file it will be silently ignored,
if given for an output file it will cause SoX to exit with an error.
.TP
.B .avr
Audio Visual Research.
The AVR format is produced by a number of commercial packages
on the Mac.
.TP
.B .caf (libsndfile)
Core Audio File format.
.TP
\&\fB.cdda\fR, \fB.cdr\fR
`Red Book' Compact Disc Digital Audio.
CDDA has two audio channels formatted as 16-bit
signed integers at a sample rate of 44\*d1\ kHz.  The number of (stereo)
samples in each CDDA track is always a multiple of 588 which is why it
needs its own handler.
.TP
\&\fB.cvsd\fR, \fB.cvs\fR
Continuously Variable Slope Delta modulation.
A headerless format used to compress speech audio for applications such as voice mail.
This format is sometimes used with bit-reversed samples\*mthe
.B \-X
format option can be used to set the bit-order.
.TP
.B .dat
Text Data files.
These files contain a textual representation of the
sample data.  There is one line at the beginning
that contains the sample rate.  Subsequent lines
contain two numeric data items: the time since
the beginning of the first sample and the sample value.
Values are normalized so that the maximum and minimum
are 1 and \-1.  This file format can be used to
create data files for external programs such as
FFT analysers or graph routines.  SoX can also convert
a file in this format back into one of the other file
formats.
.TP
\&\fB.dvms\fR, \fB.vms\fR
Used in Germany to compress speech audio for voice mail.
A self-describing variant of
.BR cvsd .
.TP
.B .fap (libsndfile)
See
.BR .paf .
.TP
.B ffmpeg
This is a pseudo-type that forces ffmpeg to be used. The actual file
type is deduced from the file name (it cannot be used on stdio). This
pseudo-type depends on SoX having been built with optional ffmpeg
support. It can read a wide range of audio files, not all of which are
documented here, and also the audio track of many video files
(including AVI, WMV and MPEG). At present only the first audio track
of a file can be read.
.TP
.B .flac (also with \-t sndfile)
Free Lossless Audio CODEC compressed audio.
FLAC is an open, patent-free CODEC designed for compressing
music.  It is similar to MP3 and Ogg Vorbis, but lossless,
meaning that audio is compressed in FLAC without any loss in
quality.
.SP
SoX can decode native FLAC files (.flac) but not Ogg FLAC files (.ogg).
[But see
.B .ogg
below for information relating to support for Ogg
Vorbis files.]
.SP
SoX has basic support for writing FLAC files: it can encode to
native FLAC using compression levels 0 to 8.  8 is the default
compression level and gives the best (but slowest) compression;
0 gives the least (but fastest) compression.  The compression
level can be selected using the
.B \-C
option (see above) with a whole number from 0 to 8.
.SP
FLAC support in
SoX is optional and requires optional FLAC libraries.  To
see if there is support for FLAC run
.EX
	sox -h
.EE
and look for
it under the list of supported file formats as `flac'.
.TP
.B .fssd
An alias for the
.B .ub
format.
.TP
.B .gsm (also with \-t sndfile)
GSM 06.10 Lossy Speech Compression.
A lossy format for compressing speech which is used in the
Global Standard for Mobile telecommunications (GSM).  It's good
for its purpose, shrinking audio data size, but it will introduce
lots of noise when a given audio signal is encoded and decoded
multiple times.  This format is used by some voice mail applications.
It is rather CPU intensive.
.SP
GSM in
SoX is optional and requires access to an external GSM library.  To see
if there is support for GSM run
.EX
	sox -h
.EE
and look for it under the list of supported file formats.
.TP
.B .hcom
Macintosh HCOM files.
These are (apparently) Mac FSSD files with some variant
of Huffman compression.
The Macintosh has wacky file formats and this format
handler apparently doesn't handle all the ones it should.
Mac users will need their usual arsenal of file converters
to deal with an HCOM file on other systems.
.TP
.B ircam (also with \-t sndfile)
Another name for
.BR .sf .
.TP
.B .ima (also with \-t sndfile)
A headerless file of IMA ADPCM audio data. IMA ADPCM claims 16-bit precision
packed into only 4 bits, but in fact sounds no better than
.BR .vox .
.TP
\&\fB.lpc\fR, \fB.lpc10\fR
LPC-10 is a compression scheme for speech developed in the United
States. See http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~jaf/lpc/ for details. There is
no associated file format, so SoX's implementation is headerless.
.TP
\&\fB.mat\fR, \fB.mat4\fR, \fB.mat5\fR \fB(libsndfile)\fR
Matlab 4.2/5.0 (respectively GNU Octave 2.0/2.1) format (.mat is the same as .mat4).
.TP
.B .m3u
A
.I playlist
format; contains a list of audio files.
See [1] for details of this format.
.TP
.B .maud
An IFF-conforming audio file type, registered by
MS MacroSystem Computer GmbH, published along
with the `Toccata' sound-card on the Amiga.
Allows 8bit linear, 16bit linear, A-Law, \(*m-law
in mono and stereo.
.TP
\&\fB.mp3\fR, \fB.mp2\fR
MP3 compressed audio.  MP3 (MPEG Layer 3) is part of the
MPEG standards for audio and video compression.  It is a lossy
compression format that achieves good compression rates with little
quality loss.  See also
.B Ogg Vorbis
for a similar format.
.SP
MP3 support in
SoX is optional and requires access to either or both the external
libmad and libmp3lame libraries. To see if there is support for MP3 run
.EX
	sox -h
.EE
and look for it under the list of supported file formats as `mp3'.
.SP
.TP
\&\fB.mp4\fR, \fB.m4a\fR \fB(ffmpeg)\fR
MP4 compressed audio.  MP3 (MPEG 4) is part of the
MPEG standards for audio and video compression.  See
.B mp3
for more information.
.SP
MP4 support in SoX is optional and requires access to the external
ffmpeg libraries.
.TP
.B .nist (also with \-t sndfile)
See \fB.sph\fR.
.TP
\&\fB.ogg\fR, \fB.vorbis\fR
Ogg Vorbis compressed audio.
Ogg Vorbis is a open, patent-free CODEC designed for compressing music
and streaming audio.  It is a lossy compression format (similar to MP3,
VQF & AAC) that achieves good compression rates with a minimum amount of
quality loss.  See also
.B MP3
for a similar format.
.SP
SoX can decode all types of Ogg Vorbis files, and can encode at different
compression levels/qualities given as a number from \-1 (highest
compression/lowest quality) to 10 (lowest compression, highest quality).
By default the encoding quality level is 3 (which gives an encoded rate
of approx. 112kbps), but this can be changed using the
.B \-C
option (see above) with a number from \-1 to 10; fractional numbers (e.g.
3\*d6) are also allowed.
.SP
Decoding is somewhat CPU intensive and encoding is very CPU intensive.
.SP
Ogg Vorbis in
SoX is optional and requires access to external Ogg Vorbis libraries.  To
see if there is support for Ogg Vorbis run
.EX
	sox -h
.EE
and look for it under the list of supported file formats as `vorbis'.
.TP
.B oss
OSS /dev/dsp device driver.
This is a pseudo-file that can be optionally compiled into SoX.  Run
.EX
	sox -h
.EE
to see if it is supported. When this driver is used it allows you to
play and record sounds on supported systems. When playing audio
files it attempts to set up the OSS driver to use the same format as
the input file. It is suggested to always override the output values
to use the highest quality format your OSS system can handle. Example:
.EX
	sox infile -t oss -2 -s /dev/dsp
.EE
.TP
\&\fB.paf\fR, \fB.fap\fR \fB(libsndfile)\fR
Ensoniq PARIS file format (big and little-endian respectively).
.TP
.B .pls
A
.I playlist
format; contains a list of audio files.
See [2] for details of this format.
.SP
Note: SHOUTcast PLS relies on
.BR wget (1)
and is only partially supported: it's necessary to
specify the audio type manually, e.g.
.EX
	play -t mp3 \(dqhttp://a.server/pls?rn=265&file=filename.pls\(dq
.EE
and SoX does not know about alternative servers\*mhit Ctrl-C twice in
quick succession to quit.
.TP
.B .prc
Psion Record. Used in Psion EPOC PDAs (Series 5, Revo and similar) for
System alarms and recordings made by the built-in Record application.
When writing, SoX defaults to A-law, which is recommended; if you must
use ADPCM, then use the \fB\-i\fR switch. The sound quality is poor
because Psion Record seems to insist on frames of 800 samples or
fewer, so that the ADPCM CODEC has to be reset at every 800 frames,
which causes the sound to glitch every tenth of a second.
.TP
.B .pvf (libsndfile)
Portable Voice Format.
.TP
.B .sd2 (libsndfile)
Sound Designer 2 format.
.TP
.B .sds (libsndfile)
MIDI Sample Dump Standard.
.TP
.B .sf (also with \-t sndfile)
IRCAM SDIF (Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique
Sound Description Interchange Format). Used by academic music software
such as the CSound package, and the MixView sound sample editor.
.TP
\&\fB.sph\fR, \fB.nist\fR \fB(also with \-t sndfile)\fR
SPHERE (SPeech HEader Resources) is a file format defined by NIST
(National Institute of Standards and Technology) and is used with
speech audio.  SoX can read these files when they contain
\(*m-law and PCM data.  It will ignore any header information that
says the data is compressed using \fIshorten\fR compression and
will treat the data as either \(*m-law or PCM.  This will allow SoX
and the command line \fIshorten\fR program to be run together using
pipes to encompasses the data and then pass the result to SoX for processing.
.TP
.B .smp
Turtle Beach SampleVision files.
SMP files are for use with the PC-DOS package SampleVision by Turtle Beach
Softworks.  This package is for communication to several MIDI samplers.  All
sample rates are supported by the package, although not all are supported by
the samplers themselves.  Currently loop points are ignored.
.TP
.B .snd
See
.BR .au .
.TP
.B sndfile
This is a pseudo-type that forces libsndfile to be used. For writing files, the
actual file type is then taken from the output file name; for reading
them, it is deduced from the file.
This pseudo-type depends on SoX having been built with optional
libsndfile support.
.TP
.B .sndt
Sndtool files.
This format dates from the MS-DOS era.
Bizarrely, this file type can also be used to read Sounder files.
.TP
.B .sou
An alias for the
.B .ub
format.
.TP
.B sunau
Sun /dev/audio device driver.
This is a pseudo-file type and can be optionally compiled into SoX.  Run
.EX
	sox -h
.EE
to see if you have support for this file type.  When this driver is used
it allows you to open up a Sun /dev/audio file and configure it to
use the same data type as passed in to SoX.
It works for both playing and recording audio files.  When playing audio
files it attempts to set up the audio driver to use the same format as the
input file.  It is suggested to always override the output values to use
the highest quality format your hardware can handle.  Example:
.EX
	sox infile -t sunau -2 -s /dev/audio
.EE
or
.EX
	sox infile -t sunau -U -c 1 /dev/audio
.EE
for older sun equipment.
.TP
.B .txw
Yamaha TX-16W sampler.
A file format from a Yamaha sampling keyboard which wrote IBM-PC
format 3\*d5\(dq floppies.  Handles reading of files which do not have
the sample rate field set to one of the expected by looking at some
other bytes in the attack/loop length fields, and defaulting to
33\ kHz if the sample rate is still unknown.
.TP
.B .vms
See
.BR .dvms .
.TP
.B .voc (also with \-t sndfile)
Sound Blaster VOC files.
VOC files are multi-part and contain silence parts, looping, and
different sample rates for different chunks.
On input, the silence parts are filled out, loops are rejected,
and sample data with a new sample rate is rejected.
Silence with a different sample rate is generated appropriately.
On output, silence is not detected, nor are impossible sample rates.
Note, this version now supports playing VOC files with multiple
blocks and supports playing files containing \(*m-law and A-law samples.
.TP
.B .vorbis
See
.BR .ogg .
.TP
.B .vox (also with \-t sndfile)
A headerless file of Dialogic/OKI ADPCM audio data commonly comes with the
extension .vox.  This ADPCM data has 12-bit precision packed into only 4-bits.
.SP
Note: some early Dialogic hardware does not always reset the ADPCM
encoder at the start of each vox file.  This can result in clipping
and/or DC offset problems when it comes to decoding the audio.  Whilst
little can be done about the clipping, a DC offset can be removed by
passing the decoded audio through a high-pass filter, e.g.:
.EX
	sox input.vox output.au highpass 10
.EE
.TP
.B .w64 (libsndfile)
Sonic Foundry's 64-bit RIFF/WAV format.
.TP
.B .wav \fB(also with \-t sndfile)\fR
Microsoft .WAV RIFF files.
This is the native audio file format of Windows, and widely used for uncompressed audio.
.SP
Normally \fB.wav\fR files have all formatting information
in their headers, and so do not need any format options
specified for an input file.  If any are, they will
override the file header, and you will be warned to this effect.
You had better know what you are doing! Output format
options will cause a format conversion, and the \fB.wav\fR
will written appropriately.
.SP
SoX currently can read PCM, \(*m-law, A-law, MS ADPCM, and IMA (or DVI) ADPCM.
It can write all of these formats including the ADPCM encoding.
Big endian versions of RIFF files, called RIFX, can also be read
and written.  To write a RIFX file, use the
.B \-B
option with the output file options.
.TP
.B .wavpcm
A non-standard variant of
.BR .wav .
Some applications cannot read a standard WAV file header for PCM-encoded
data with sample-size greater than 16-bits, but can read a non-standard
WAV header.  It is likely that such applications will eventually be
updated to support the standard header, but in the mean time, this SoX
format can be used to create files with the non-standard header that
should work with these applications.  (Note that SoX will automatically
detect and read WAV files with the non-standard header.)
.TP
.B .wve
Psion 8-bit A-law.  Used on Psion SIBO PDAs (Series 3 and similar).
.TP
.B .xa
Maxis XA files.
These are 16-bit ADPCM audio files used by Maxis games.  Writing .xa files is
currently not supported, although adding write support should not be very
difficult.
.TP
.B .xi (libsndfile)
Fasttracker 2 Extended Instrument format.
