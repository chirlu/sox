** tremolo: Sinusoidal volume modulation

* Volume/level effects
** compand: Signal level compression/expansion/limiting
** contrast: Phase contrast volume enhancement
** dcshift: Apply or remove DC offset
** fade: Apply a fade-in and/or fade-out to the audio
** gain: Apply gain or attenuation; normalise/equalise/balance/headroom
** loudness: Gain control with ISO 226 loudness compensation
** mcompand: Multi-band compression/expansion/limiting
** norm: Normalise to 0dB (or other)
** vol: Adjust audio volume

* Editing effects
** pad: Pad (usually) the ends of the audio with silence
** silence: Remove portions of silence from the audio
** splice: Perform the equivalent of a cross-faded tape splice
** trim: Cuts portions out of the audio
** vad: Voice activity detector

* Mixing effects
** channels: Auto mix or duplicate to change number of channels
** divide+: Divide sample values by those in the 1st channel (W.I.P.)
** remix: Produce arbitrarily mixed output channels
** swap: Swap stereo channels

* Pitch/tempo effects
** bend: Bend pitch at given times without changing tempo
** pitch: Adjust pitch (= key) without changing tempo
** speed: Adjust pitch & tempo together
** stretch: Adjust tempo without changing pitch (simple alg.)
** tempo: Adjust tempo without changing pitch (WSOLA alg.)

* Mastering effects
** dither: Add dither noise to increase quantisation SNR
** rate: Change audio sampling rate

* Analysis `effects'
** noiseprof: Produce a DFT profile of the audio (use with noisered)
** spectrogram: graph signal level vs. frequency & time (needs `libpng')
** stat: Enumerate audio peak & RMS levels, approx. freq., etc.
** stats: Multichannel aware `stat'

* Miscellaneous effects
** ladspa: Apply LADSPA plug-in effects e.g. CMT (Computer Music Toolkit)
** synth: Synthesise/modulate audio tones or noise signals
** newfile: Create a new output file when an effects chain ends.
** restart: Restart 1st effects chain when multiple chains exist.

* Low-level signal processing effects
** biquad: 2nd-order IIR filter using externally provided coefficients
** downsample: Reduce sample rate by discarding samples
** fir: FFT convolution FIR filter using externally provided coefficients
** upsample: Increase sample rate by zero stuffing

  + Experimental or incomplete effect; may change in future.

Multiple audio files can be combined (and then further processed with
effects) using any one of the following combiner methods:

* concatenate
* mix
* merge: E.g. two mono files to one stereo file
* sequence: For playing multiple audio files/streams
